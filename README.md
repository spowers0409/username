# C++ Username Verification

This project started as a buffer overload project that would cause an error if too many numbers were added to input. For my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone class, I am tasked with advancing the program and adding in more complex ideas. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

These are the tools that I used and you will need:

* Visual Studio 2019
* Windows 10

### Installation

Use the below command to include a clone of this repository into a local repository. After cloning, open up Visual Studio 2019, search and open the folder containing your new local repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/spowers0409/username.git
```

## Usage

## Purpose for this program

The point of recreating this project was to include some real world results. This sort of program is an extremely simple version of verifying usernames for access, and providing the correct username a unique "pin number" that could allow access to a database or other program as seen fit. Below you will see how this project was created before I made any kind of changes to it.

After deciding on how what I wanted to make the changes do, the below images will show you the changes that I made and the outputs that come from those changes

If a name is entered and matches a string that is already in the array, then a unique pin number will be displayed for the user.

If a name does not exist then an error will return to let you know that a match was not found.
